# asc-perceptron
Training an artificial perceptron for classification

In this assignment, you will be implementing and training one of the earliest algorithmically described machine learning algorithms for classification: the perceptron. You will be using Python to build the perceptron from scratch and then train it to classify different flower species in the Iris dataset. This task will provide you with a deeper understanding of machine learning algorithms for classification and their efficient implementation in Python.


# Task

1. Implement the functions in `assignments/assignment.py`

2. Implement `assignments/experiment.py` by following the instruction in the comment out and generate a plot. Save the plot as png and put it under `figs` folder with name `decision_region.png`. Make sure to add the X and Y labels!!!

3. Git commit & Push Your edit and the generated figure


### Instruction

1. You can import `assignments/utils.py` and use their functions (if any)

1. You can verify your implementation by using `notebooks/develop.py`. If you prefer to work with Jupyter notebook, you can convert the Python script by jupytext. `jupytext --to notebook <name_of_script_file>.py`

2. [You can review your autograding results](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/learn-with-github-classroom/view-autograding-results)

3. If you have any questions, use a special "Feedback" pull request to specify the part in question in the code. And text the instructors with the link. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/leave-feedback-with-pull-requests) for this Feedback pull request.
